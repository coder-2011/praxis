Hooks to make your agent write significantly cleaner code. When I write skills and prompts, I actually use them (unlike most slop you find). It injects a piece of text before every single code edit, that convinces the model to think deeper before writing any code, and follow a set of fairly strict guidelines.

If anyone is willing to, you can fork the repo and customize it to a language.

It is a fairly hacky approach to make models metacognitive. A much better approach is to have a lighter weight agent look over all conversations, and direct them. that is the final form of agentic loops. Unfortunately, this is economically unfeasible for me, but hopefully someone else can do this.
